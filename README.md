This repository processes the CSV file outputs of pose estimations for rats and calculates various analyses. 

In order to run this code, there are a few files that need to be downloaded. 

(1) Because the zip file of all the CSV files was too big, there are 8 different files that need to be downloaded and then compiled into one singular folder. You must change the file  path to this folder in the code. 

(2) You must download the preprocessing text file that includes the time delays for each video, so that only the experiment is being assessed. You must also change the file path to the video. 

The 3 types of analyses are 

(1) Error rate per body part
(2) Quantification of potential interactions using head direction
(3) Quantification of fearful freezing behavior 


The videos needed to run the DeepLabCut model can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r5-B-159htMGq9SK7g0ec0tJV7g7_-IY?usp=sharing
