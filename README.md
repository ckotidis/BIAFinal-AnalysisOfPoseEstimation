This repository processes CSV files and calculates various analyses. 

In order to run this code, there are a few files that need to be downloaded. 

(1) Because the zip file of all the CSV files was too big, there are 8 different files that need to be downloaded and then compiled into one singular folder. You must change the file  path to this folder in the code. 

(2) You must download the preprocessing text file that includes the delays for each video, so that only the experiment is being assessed. You must also change the file path to the video.
